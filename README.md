2) Change the path to the folder of MLCourseLab
3) Check the completeness. This folder should at least include two jupyter files: Neural_Network.ipynb and PhasePicking.ipynb. It also includes 3 data files: Continous_Waveforms.npz, Label.npy, and Waveform.npy. 
4) Get familiar with the JupyterLab Interface: https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html

## Finish Two Labs: Neural_Network and PhasePicking
1) Finish exercises in Neural_Network.ipynb and PhasePicking.ipynb files.
2) Write a report about neural network and convolutional neural network in pdf file.
